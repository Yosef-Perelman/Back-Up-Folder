- Assignment I did as part of the Communication Networks course.
- In this assignment i created a client - server connection so that the client selects a particular folder and synchronizes it with the server. 
Every time the client changes something in the folder, he notifies the server and the server performs the same change in his folder, 
and also updates other devices of the same client that requested to be synchronized to the folder too.
